Cloud SQL Replication Setup:
 -Before the outage, set up Cloud SQL cross-region replication (with a primary database in the us-central1 region and a replica in another region like us-east1 or europe-west1).
 -Ensure automatic failover is enabled in the Cloud SQL instance for seamless replication.]\n",
