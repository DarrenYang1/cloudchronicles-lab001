    "**Situation:**  \n",
    "[A regional outage has occurred in the us-central1 region, impacting services running in that area. This affects databases, storage, and application availability for workloads relying solely on this region.]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:**  \n",
    "[The task is to implement a Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan using Google Cloud tools, ensuring high availability and quick failover to minimize downtime and data loss. The key components will include Cloud SQL replicas, multi-region Cloud Storage, and Pub/Sub alerts to facilitate the detection, failover, and recovery process.]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Action:**  \n",
    "Cloud SQL Replication Setup: \n",
    "- Before the outage, set up Cloud SQL cross-region replication (with a primary database in the us-central1 region and a replica in another region like us-east1 or europe-west1). \n",
    "- Ensure automatic failover is enabled in the Cloud SQL instance for seamless replication. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Result:**  \n",
    "[The Disaster Recovery Plan ensures that:]\n",
    "- Cloud SQL replication and automatic failover ensure continuity for database services across regions with minimal downtime. \n",
    "- Multi-region Cloud Storage guarantees that data remains available without interruption, even if us-central1 is down. \n",
    "- Pub/Sub alerts and Cloud Monitoring provide real-time notifications of the outage, enabling automated responses and manual intervention when needed. \n",
    "- Automation (via Cloud Functions or Cloud Run) can be implemented to expedite the recovery process and reduce human intervention. \n",
